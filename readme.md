To start choose command npm run server
To test backend use Postman
To get environmental secret key use physical book notes

don't forget npm install before starting working.

there is a concurrently dev dependency that allows starting the whole thing with the command: npm run dev

But frontend is separated and this command is not working.

use separate repository for the frontend changes
